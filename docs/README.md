## Implemented Algorithms

### Greedy Algorithms
- **Activity Selection**: Selects the maximum number of non-overlapping activities.
- **Fractional Knapsack**: Solves the fractional knapsack problem to maximize value.
- **Huffman Coding**: Constructs an optimal prefix code for data compression.
- **Kruskal's Algorithm**: Finds the Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) of a graph.
- **Prim's Algorithm**: Another approach to find the MST of a graph.

### Divide and Conquer
- **Binary Search**: Efficiently searches for an element in a sorted array.
- **Closest Pair of Points**: Finds the closest pair of points in a 2D plane.
- **Merge Sort**: Sorts an array using the divide-and-conquer paradigm.
- **Quick Sort**: Another efficient sorting algorithm.

### Dynamic Programming
- **Floyd-Warshall Algorithm**: Finds shortest paths between all pairs of vertices in a graph.

### Graph Algorithms
- **Dijkstra's Algorithm**: Finds the shortest path from a source vertex to all other vertices.
